# rand-num

<h1>My first Python Program! üêçüñ•Ô∏è</h1>
<p>Rand-num is a Command-Line Inteface Python Program, and was written from November 23 - Present Day. It started out as a simple guess the number game betweem 1-10 game, but when Version 1.2.0 arrived, you could choose how many numbers you wanted to guess between. By Version 1.5.0, you could choose if you wanted lives/hearts ‚ù§Ô∏è in the game, and if you did, you would recieve a certain amount of hearts based on a mathematical function I created. New features that will be merged from other branches soon include the computer recognizing and asking again for input if the input a user gives does not fit the paramaters. This will be done using the Try...Except keyword. Pull requests are REQUESTED and we would love to hear feedback, whether it's a bug fix or and idea!</p>
